## 🛠 Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bibliosmia.git
cd bibliosmia
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies (Do these sequentially)
    
    #### Download and install xampp
    #### Download and install composer
    #### Open Xampp and start apache and mysql server

### 3️⃣ Configure Environment
As the `.env` file is excluded from the version control, you have to generate a new `.env` file and generate a new key for the laravel app.

```sh
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
```
After that set up database credentials in `.env`:

```env
DB_DATABASE=bibliosmia
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
```

Now if you want to recreate the databases Do the Following. But if you don't want the hassle and happy to use my already created database, Go to step 7️⃣.

### 4️⃣ Create Database
*	Go to localhost/phpmyadmin (make sure the apache and mysql servers are turned on in the xampp app).
*	Click on SQL from the top of the page 
*	Type the following query:  

```sh
CREATE DATABASE bibliosmia_db and hit GO.
```

*	The database named bibliosmia_db is now created.


### 5️⃣ Migration
Now run migration (As the tables mentioned in the laravel app is not created in the database yet).

```sh
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```
This will create all the necessary tables and an admin with the following credentials:

```env
    Name: ‘Admin’
	Email:  ‘admin@bibliosmia.com’
	Password:  ‘password’

```
### 6️⃣ Serve

```sh
php artisan serve
```

Now, visit **http://127.0.0.1:8000** in your browser. 🎉
Login into the admin panel using the admin's credentials to have all the necessary admin's access , delete, edit books and other things.
